# Groggle
Boggle clone with custom boards, custom board sizes (eventually), automatic board solving and more!
Slowly turning into an all-in-one Boggle utility

# TODO
- Find new allowed Boggle words (roman numerals are no good)
- Add actual game functionality
- Add rules
- Input custom boards
- Add custom words to dictionary
- Accept command line arguments for custom boards
- Maybe change dice distributions, the boards seem too hard (maybe that's how Boggle is supposed to be)
- Switch io stuff to ncurses for better GUI and better portability

# COMPLETED
- Dictionary
- Board generator using default Boggle distribution
- Board solver (fairly efficient, takes about 3 seconds)

# Changeloggle
- 10/23 Initial commit, with board generator and solver
