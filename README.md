# Groggle
Boggle clone with custom boards, custom board sizes (eventually), automatic board solving and more!

# TODO
- Find new allowed Boggle words (roman numerals are no good)
- Add actual game functionality
- Add rules
- Accept command line arguments for custom boards
- Maybe change dice distributions, the boards seem too hard (maybe that's how Boggle is supposed to be)
- Switch io stuff to ncurses for better GUI and for better portability
